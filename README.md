# Deloitte-Case-Study
Deloitte case study is a bussiness intilligence project where i submitted all the required conclusions given below:
1. As the data is quite unstructured, if the individual is able to structure it and draw
insights from it
2. The typical dashboard will have slicers for Country and Time period (Monthly,
Quarterly and Yearly) and trend analysis for Exchange Rate, CPI and Exports in a
single tab
3. If the individual is able to do a YoY, CAGR analysis on that dataset
4. Graphical representation of data and whether it is dynamic in nature i.e., if the data
changes for all three charts when slicers are applied
Deduplication and removal of redundancies â€“ whether the individual is able to remove
redundancies and erroneous results

I have created some meaningful reports, made a dashboard according to the given data and showcased insights using tableau
